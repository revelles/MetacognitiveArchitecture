## Abstract

Large language models demonstrate increasingly sophisticated reasoning
but lack persistent, hierarchical governance over cognition, continuity,
and anti-fabrication safeguards. This paper introduces the
**Metacognitive Architecture & Instruction Layers**, a modular framework
designed to implement an **Instructional Operating System (IOS)** for
AI systems. By decoupling content-production layers (L0–L1) from
control-governance layers (L2–L3), the architecture enables structured,
auditable, and domain-isolated reasoning suitable for high-stakes,
long-horizon applications.
